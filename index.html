      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born in 1993 in small village in Ukraine. I grew up playing soccer.When i went to college I started doing mma. I loved it a lot, one time i went to national championship and even got a bronze medal, for my 3rd place. Right now I'm too old for wrestling, mma, etc. so I switched to running. It is not as entertaining but it let's me stay in shape. I started codin last month, but there's still lots to learn.</p>
